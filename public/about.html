                Originating from the Sanskrit script, Anukriti essentially means a photograph. That is what we want to bring to you. A photograph of India in its truest form.

<h2>
In today’s day and age of machine made goods and cutting edge technology, we have forgotten the beauty  of handmade Indian handicrafts. India is known for its rich culture and diversity. Each of India’s 29 states produce their own local handicrafts. The skill, finesse and technique with which each handicraft is intricately crafted is unparalleled. However, the handicrafts industry is not in a god shape.

Craftsmen and local artisans are facing extensive competition from machine made goods manufactured by big companies. The huge shift from handmade goods to cheaper machine made goods has extensively hampered the business of the handicrafts industry. Declining demand, lack of marketing skills, resource crunches and especially the COVID 19 pandemic has brought the local crafts industry into the doldrums.

This is what we want to change. We want to bring back the old grandeur of the handicrafts industry. With that vision in mind, we bring to you - some of the most exclusive and beautiful handicrafts specially hand made by the local artisans from the rural villages of India. We have developed an extremely user friendly system that will serve as a platform for artisans from rural and remote villages to sell their handmade crafts. Each product that you view on our website has been specially created by the hands of rural artisans of India. We have displayed a wide range of appealing products from which you can choose.

Thank you for sharing our vision and helping us grow the handicrafts industry in India.
